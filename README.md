# Umbral Mithrix

**_SUBMIT ANY ISSUES FOUND WITH A LOG TO THE LINK ABOVE_**

Major reworks to the fight, a new trophy item, and a practice mode. When you spawn on the moon there'll be a shrine to optionally activate the mode. You only need to interact with it once. When completing the fight you'll get a trophy item to track your victories against Umbral.

### Important Info

- Phase 4 can be toggled on/off in the config.
- Arena visuals and purple VFX can be toggled on/off in the config.
- Base stats are balanced around "vanilla" E8, increase stats or tweak attack configs to add difficulty based on your own gameplay/needs.
- "Practice Mode" is activated by interacting with the shrine to your left when you spawn in on the moon. It gives you infinite revives during the fight, Phase 4 won't give you the speed buff and pizza attacks may not spawn if you die during this phase with practice mode.
- The "Core of the Collective" item dropped after the fight is completed does nothing, it's there to track victories against Umbral (in the logbook) and act as a "trophy".

### Practice Mode

Practice mode just makes you respawn on death in case you want to learn/practice the fight but don't want to do a whole other run (infinite dio's). The trophy item won't spawn at the end of the fight. The mode deactivates after Mithrix dies in Phase 4.

### Config Info

You can edit config values in-game and during runs through Settings -> Mod Options -> UmbralMithrix. Stats are calculated at the start of each phase so you can change in-game configs up until the phase starts. If the in-game values are too limiting you can edit the modman config to input custom values.
